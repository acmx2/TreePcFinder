1. Two binary types could be compiled from the source: SmTreePc.arx plug-in for AutoCad 2010...2013 (both win32 and x64 versions) and 
a console application SmTreePc.exe (both win32 and x64 versions too). 
The console .exe versions are compiled from the Visual Studio project configurations named with 'Console' suffix. 
Note, the console .exe doesn't depend on the ObjectArx as well as on other libraries except for the standard C++ ones.


2. Arx usage: load SmTreePc.arx into AutoCad and type PC_ADD.
Provide a point cloud txt file path as an argument for that command, e.g. PC_ADD z:\pcs\scans\Tree1.txt
This command shows the cloud and prints the tree parameters. The debug configuration of this command draws a line and two circles correspondent 
to the measured parameters.


3. Console command usage:
SmTreePc.exe file_name, e.g. SmTreePc.exe z:\pcs\scans\Tree1.txt


4. The input point cloud should be in
* txt point cloud format
* feet units
* and should contain a tree scan (or something like tree), one shot scans are allowed.


5. Command output looks like the following:

Tree parameters are calculated:
Height: 29.147949
Dripline diameter: 23.591715
Trunk diameter: 0.860223
